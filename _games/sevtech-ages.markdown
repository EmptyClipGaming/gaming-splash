# Welcome to Empty Clip's Sevtech Ages Server

SevTech: Ages is a massive modpack packed with content and progression. This pack focuses on providing the player a long term progression experience with purpose. SevTech introduces a number of mechanics never before done such as: hiding ore until unlocked, dynamically hidden items and recipes based on progress, new mobs appear as you progress further and much more! The modpack uses the vanilla advancement system to guide the player along while still allowing an open, sandbox experience. As you progress through the hundreds of custom advancements you will unlock new "ages" which will show you new mods to work through. 

SevTech aims to introduce many mods not frequently used while altering some more widely known mods. The pack also features a ton of custom mods for the best player experience. 

You'll start your first world with nothing. No map or HWYLA and only a handful of items and recipes. As you progress, you will unlock those features, thousands of items and blocks, and much more. Your goal is to follow through the advancement system from the stone age all the way into space!

Every feature in SevTech: Ages can be done in Multiplayer, too! Every progression point is player based and not server based. This means you can play on a large server and not be left behind if you start after every one else. The pack also provides the mod "Together Forever" to let players form teams and sync progression. The World Type is suggested to be "quark_realistic".

Note: This pack will continue to add content after its initial release. The aim of these updates will be to provide a prestige system, more advancements, extra end-game content, and bug fixes. We will do everything in our power to make sure no update will corrupt worlds and a transition into a new update is as smooth as possible.

## Rules

1. Be Friendly - No one likes a jerk, in general the server is PG-13 but be kind to other players.
2. Be Respectful - This goes with the first one, if you have to think about it, don't do it.
3. Keep the World Beautiful - Try not to build any 1x1 towers into the sky, the pack has lots of tools to make pretty builds, give it a shot.
4. Do not PVP without permission - If you would like to PvP with someone then please get their permission first, if we have problems then I have to deal with it.
5. Don't take whats not yours - Simple, if you didn't get it for yourself and they aren't giving it to you, don't touch it, again if theres problems I can fix it.
6. Respect other's space - Be mindful of other people's bases and space. No one likes to find out they got boxed in, least of all by other players. If you aren't sure leave a message in the discord.
